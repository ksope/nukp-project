                <h4 class="manifesto-sub-header">Introduction:</h4>
                    <p>
                        We feel our current education system, to put it mildly, is ridiculous. Kids are being cheated of using their greatest asset to the fullest: their minds. Instead of stimulating them, we seem to be dumbing them down, and this in turn leads them to boredom and then to be 'educated' from more nefarious sources such as social media, hyper graphic video games, online activities that remain unchecked.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h4 class="manifesto-sub-header">Vision:</h4>
                    <p>
                        To cultivate an inclusive, equitable, and dynamic education system in the United Kingdom that fosters creativity, thinking outside the box, and lifelong learning. To develop a passion for learning, to understand the beauty of knowledge and to challenge existing thinking systems (which is what the NUKP is about!). To create an honest and healthy appetite for learning which will set our kids free from the shackles of nefarious ideologies that they gravitate to for mental stimulation which is not provided in the current school education system.This deterioration and rot has been going on for decades irrespective of which party has assumed power. This system will equip all individuals with the skills, knowledge, and values needed to thrive in a rapidly changing world and contribute positively to society, and compete once again on the globalised platforms that encourage and sponsor the creation of the best talent within an individual.
                    </p>
